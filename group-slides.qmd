## Literature Review {.smaller}

-   RF outperforms models like Naive Bayes and SVM by adjusting tree numbers and feature selection, using AUC as the main performance metric.[@Khoshgoftaar2007-bo]

-   RF handles both classification and regression tasks by creating multiple decision trees, offering resilience against overfitting.[@Biau2016-ac]

-   RF outperforms logistic regression in predicting retention and profitability, emphasizing the role of sales behavior in customer outcomes.[@Lariviere2005-uq]

-   RF accurately identifies core suppliers using e-invoice data with an AUC of 89.58%, improving procurement accuracy while reducing human bias.[@Hong2018-fr]

-   RF, using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), classifies customer reviews with 81% precision, offering valuable insights for tailoring business offerings to specific customer needs.[@Torizuka2018-if]

-   Random Credal RF uses credal sets for increased robustness and accuracy, handling noisy datasets better than Oblique RF, but with added complexity.[@Mantas2019-li]
