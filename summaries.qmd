# Articles and Their Summaries

## 1. A Comparison of Random Forest Based Algorithms: Random Credal Random Forest versus Oblique Random Forest

The study compares Random Credal Random Forest and Oblique Random Forest models to distinguish if one model performs better than the other when applied to noisy data sets in particular. Both algorithms use bagging and feature randomness in the trees.  However, the Random Credal Random Forest also modifies the output data using credal sets, or a range of possibilities.  Applying probability ranges made the RCRF model more robust, improving accuracy and computational efficiency.

“An important characteristic of the ensemble methods as RF is that the base classifiers of the forest must be diverse. In a ensemble scheme, there is little gain combining similar classifiers, so the improvement of the ensemble relies on the diversity of the base classifiers, provided that this diversity does not diminish the accuracy of the ensemble members. RF achieves diversity of the trees by means of two properties: (a) Bagging employed for the selection of the instances used as input for each tree and (b) the random set of features considered as candidates for each node.”

“Key properties of the Random Forest method include using the bagging technique for the decision tree instances and then using random sets of features in each node.”

## 2. An Empirical Study of Learning from Imbalanced Data Using Random Forest

The article attempts to create an empirical analysis of the Random Forest classifier's performance.  The emphasis is on the number of trees in the ensemble and the number of attributes randomly selected at each node of the trees.  The AUC, or Area Under the ROC Curve, was used to measure the classifier's ability to distinguish between the major and minority classes.

“Statistical analysis using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) models are used to determine reasonable default values for the numTrees and numFeatures parameters for all 10 datasets. In addition, we conduct experimentation to benchmark the RF learner (with the recommended numTrees and numFeatures values) with six different learners commonly-used in data mining and machine learning research. By varying the parameters numTrees and numFeatures, this work is the first to compare the RF learner's performance on imbalanced data and recommend a default setting for each of the parameters.”

## 3. A Random Forest Guided Tour

The article's goal is an overall review of the Random Forest algorithm.  Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions. For regression analysis, this is done via averaging, and for classification analysis, majority voting is used.  With just a few hyperparameters, Random Forest is able to handle high-dimensional data, while being flexible and able to deal with overfitting. Random Forest (RF) builds unpruned decision trees using random subsets of data and features, with each tree trained using the bagging process to reduce variance and improve stability. The trees split nodes based on optimized criteria, such as Gini impurity for classification or squared error for regression, until reaching a minimum number of observations.

“Bagging (a contraction of bootstrap-aggregating) is a general aggregation scheme, which generates bootstrap samples from the original data set, constructs a predictor from each sample, and decides by averaging.”

“At each node of each tree, the best cut is selected by optimizing the CART-split criterion, based on the so-called Gini impurity (for classification) or the prediction squared error (for regression).”

“the forest mechanism is versatile enough to deal with both supervised classification and regression tasks.”

“A random forest is a predictor consisting of a collection of M randomized regression trees.”

“Despite their widespread use, a gap remains between the theoretical understanding of random forests and their practical performance. This algorithm, which relies on complex data-dependent mechanisms, is difficult to analyze and its basic mathematical properties are still not well understood.”

“The Random Forest method is widely used for its performance, despite the underlying mathematical complexities.”

## 4. Predicting Customer Retention and Profitability by Using Random Forests and Regression Forests Techniques

The study aims to examine "next buy", "partial defection", and "profitability evolution" for predicting customer outcomes.  Basically, whether the customer will purchase a new product, cancel an active product, and the customer's profitability over time.  The goal is to use RF to reduce costs associated with acquiring new customers. The sample data was mined from a European financial services company. Area Under the ROC Curve was used to evaluate the "next buy" and "partial defection" classifications, while the Mean Absolute Deviation was used to evaluate the "profitability evolution".  RF handled the profit drop classification better than logistic regression.  The most influential variables were total product ownership, cross-buying, and monetary value.  Interestingly, older customers were more likely to repurchase and less likely to defect.  A major point of the study was that salespeople played a critical role in the customer outcomes.

“Random Forests consistently outperform logistic regression in predicting binary outcomes, including next buy and partial defection.”

“By incorporating intermediary variables, we observed that the sales agent’s behavior plays a critical role in predicting customer retention.”
