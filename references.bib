  abstract  = "In an era of strong customer relationship management (CRM)
               emphasis, firms strive to build valuable relationships with
               their existing customer base. In this study, we attempt to
               better understand three important measures of customer outcome:
               next buy, partial-defection and customers' profitability
               evolution. By means of random forests techniques we investigate
               a broad set of explanatory variables, including past customer
               behavior, observed customer heterogeneity and some typical
               variables related to intermediaries. We analyze a real-life
               sample of 100,000 customers taken from the data warehouse of a
               large European financial services company. Two types of random
               forests techniques are employed to analyze the data: random
               forests are used for binary classification, whereas regression
               forests are applied for the models with linear dependent
               variables. Our research findings demonstrate that both random
               forests techniques provide better fit for the estimation and
               validation sample compared to ordinary linear regression and
               logistic regression models. Furthermore, we find evidence that
               the same set of variables have a different impact on buying
               versus defection versus profitability behavior. Our findings
               suggest that past customer behavior is more important to
               generate repeat purchasing and favorable profitability
               evolutions, while the intermediary's role has a greater impact
               on the customers' defection proneness. Finally, our results
               demonstrate the benefits of analyzing different customer outcome
               variables simultaneously, since an extended investigation of the
               next buy--partial-defection--customer profitability triad
               indicates that one cannot fully understand a particular outcome
               without understanding the other related behavioral outcome

  abstract  = "Since not all suppliers are to be managed in the same way, a
               purchasing strategy requires proper supplier segmentation so
               that the most suitable strategies can be used for different
               segments. Most existing methods for supplier segmentation,
               however, either depend on subjective judgements or require
               significant efforts. To overcome the limitations, this paper
               proposes a novel approach for supplier segmentation. The
               objective of this paper is to develop an automated and effective
               way to identify core suppliers, whose profit impact on a buyer
               is significant. To achieve this objective, the application of a
               supervised machine learning technique, Random Forests (RF), to
               e-invoice data is proposed. To validate the effectiveness, the
               proposed method has been applied to real e-invoice data obtained
               from an automobile parts manufacturer. Results of high accuracy
               and the area under the curve (AUC) attest to the applicability
               of our approach. Our method is envisioned to be of value for
               automating the identification of core suppliers. The main
               benefits of the proposed approach include the enhanced
               efficiency of supplier segmentation procedures. Besides, by
               utilizing a machine learning method to e-invoice data, our
               method results in more reliable segmentation in terms of
               selecting and weighting variables.",

               powerful statistical classifier that is well established in
               other disciplines but is relatively unknown in ecology.
               Advantages of RF compared to other statistical classifiers
               include (1) very high classification accuracy; (2) a novel
               method of determining variable importance; (3) ability to model
               complex interactions among predictor variables; (4) flexibility
               to perform several types of statistical data analysis, including
               regression, classification, survival analysis, and unsupervised
               learning; and (5) an algorithm for imputing missing values. We
               compared the accuracies of RF and four other commonly used
               statistical classifiers using data on invasive plant species
               presence in Lava Beds National Monument, California, USA, rare

               sites for cavity nesting birds in the Uinta Mountains, Utah,

               applications as measured by cross-validation and, in the case of
               the lichen data, by independent test data, when comparing RF to
               other common classification methods. We also observed that the
               variables that RF identified as most important for classifying
               invasive plant species coincided with expectations based on the
